    <p>
      guitarlessons365.com uses affiliate programs for monetization, which means
      when you click on links to various merchant sites that I recommend in my
      articles and make a purchase, this can result in a commission that is
      credited to this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some affiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to,
      Commission Junction,Ã‚ Amazon.com, ClickBank, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen to only recommend products in my articles that I use or have
      thoroughly researched. My credibility online means everything to me, so I
      take my responsibility as an affiliate marketer very seriously. I also DO
      NOT do any paid reviews.
    </p>
    <p>OK, now for the legal gibble gabble...</p>
    <p>
      Even though I stand behind everything I promote, guitarlessons365.com and
      the owner (Carl Brown) assume no liability for products purchased outside
      of guitarlessons365.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that sounds harsh, but it's just legal speak. My integrity means
      everything out here and I would not personally refer you to garbage.

      <u><i>Third-Party & Sponsor Ads</i></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      Text ads that appear on the top of the page of guitarlessons365.com , near
      the bottom of pages, or above the lessons and in the right sidebar during
      a search are sponsor ads by Google AdSense (they are labeled with
      "AdChoices").
    </p>
    <p>
      guitarlessons365.com does not personally endorse the products and services
      advertised in these ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      These companies are not affiliated with guitarlessons365.com. The only
      affiliation present is the one between guitarlessons365.com and Google. In
      other words, commissions/profits are generated from Google for displaying
      these ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have questions about any affiliations on this website, please don't
      hesitate to contact me. I'll be more than happy to clarify or provide
      additional details if necessary.
